# Facial Recognition App

## A fully functional Mobile Application for Facial Recognition project utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and verify faces.

This project showcases how to apply machine learning in mobile applications, how to create REST API endpoints using FLask , how to communicate with SQlite database and how to communicate with the backend server with the fron-end user interface.
Designed the front-end user interface using React Native and designed the backend REST API using the Flask framework. Deployed the application in the AWS server.
